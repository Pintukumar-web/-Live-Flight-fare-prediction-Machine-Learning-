Introduction: This project uses machine learning to predict flight fares based on factors like date, airline, and duration, aiding users in booking decisions.

Problem Statement: Flight prices fluctuate, making it hard to find optimal booking times. Our goal is to predict fares using ML models accurately.

Dataset Description: Key features include flight date, airline, source, destination, and fare (target variable).

Project Structure: Organized into notebooks/, src/, data/, and models/ folders for streamlined navigation.

EDA Insights: Non-stop flights and popular routes have higher fares; longer durations also lead to increased prices.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned data, created new date features, encoded categories, and scaled numerical values for model compatibility.

Model Development: Implemented Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, with XGBoost performing best.

Conclusion: XGBoost delivered the best results for fare prediction, with plans for further tuning and expansion.

Future Work: Explore deep learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment for real-time prediction.
